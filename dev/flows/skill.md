# /dev skill ... — installed skill, not the board

Everything under `/dev skill` acts on the **installed skill**, never on the user's board or repo. Keep the two apart when you speak: `/dev review` is feedback on *their* work; `/dev skill feedback` is feedback on *this tool*.

`dev` ships in the `devops` package together with `ops`, installed as one clone (see https://github.com/poiurewq/devops) with each skill symlinked into the agent's skills directory. One update moves both skills. Prefs live at `~/.config/devops-skill/config.yml` (survives updates; `schema_version` like board.yml — see `scripts/skill.py`).

| Invocation | Script |
|---|---|
| `/dev skill` | `SKILL_CMD status` |
| `/dev skill update` | `SKILL_CMD update` |
| `/dev skill update auto` | `SKILL_CMD auto` (report current setting) |
| `/dev skill update auto on/off` | `SKILL_CMD auto on/off` |
| `/dev skill feedback <text>` | `SKILL_CMD feedback --title "<t>" [--body "<b>"]` |

The throttled `SKILL_CMD check` when-list stays in SKILL.md — it runs on common board commands, not only here.

## Feedback to the maintainers (`/dev skill feedback`)

Opens an issue on poiurewq/devops — the maintainer inbox for the skill itself. Not for the user's own repo, and not a way to file board tasks (that is `/dev add <task-or-goal>`); if the user seems to mean their own work, ask before filing.

Draft a title (one line) and body (the behaviour they saw and what they expected) from what the user said. **Show the draft and get their OK before running the command**, and say plainly what it does: files a GitHub issue on the public poiurewq/devops repo, which cannot be quietly undone. The script appends skill version, install kind, python, and OS. Never put repo names, paths, branch names, or task content in the title or body — this is a public repo. Report the issue URL the script prints.
