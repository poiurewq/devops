# Multi-task implement batch

Loaded only from `flows/implement.md` when the user asked for several tasks at once. Do **not** read this file for a single-id implement.

## When this applies

- Explicit multi-id: `/dev implement 13, 14, 15` (or space-separated ids).
- **All tasks under an umbrella:** expand that umbrella's `deps` — nested umbrellas expand recursively to leaves; the umbrella itself is not a batch member unless the user named it as a normal id.
- Multiple freeform description matches, only when the user clearly asked for a batch.

`/dev auto` stays one task per cycle — no auto multi-pick.

Run the steps below **before claiming anything**, then run `flows/implement.md` steps 0–7 for each id in the planned order.

## Steps

1. **Resolve** every id. Drop duplicates. Unknown id → stop and list what is missing; do not partially claim the set.
2. **Eligibility (whole set).** Load each task and apply implement.md step 0's **state preflight** to every member before claiming any. Refuse the whole batch if any member is not startable without a special user call — `done`, `not-planned`, `later`, `proposed`, open `needs: decision`, assigned to someone else, or already shipped — `draft` or `review` (resume is single-task, not batch) — listing each ineligible id and why. Soft cases that only need confirmation in single-task (`doing`, pointless-looking) still require that confirmation up front, and a member with no `Intent:` line gets one asked for and recorded up front too; without it, refuse the batch. Claim nothing until every remaining id is clear to start.
3. **Set-relative blocking.** A dep is unfinished when its status is not `done` (a missing id counts as unfinished). An **external blocker** is an unfinished dep whose id is **not** in the set. If any selected task has one, refuse the whole batch and list, per blocked task, the outside dep id(s) and their status. Deps that are already `done`, or that are other members of the set, do not block.
4. **Order.** Topological sort on edges *within* the set (A before B when B lists A in `deps`); tie-break on lower id. Cycle in the set → refuse and report it. State the order once ("implementing as 13 → 15 → 14") and proceed.
5. **Shared preflight once:** `gh auth`, then `TASKS preflight` (check only) from implement.md step 0. If any member is untagged, recommend an area per id (implement.md area sanity) and wait — do not collide or claim yet. After every member has an area, `TASKS collisions <id,id,…>` with the **whole set** (not one id). Exit 2 → refuse the batch and print the output (an outside `doing` blocker). Exit 3 → every outside blocker's PR is already open (`draft` or `review`): print the output and ask the user to proceed or wait, as in implement.md step 0 — for the batch as a whole, since the members share the claim decision. No stack option here: stacking is per member, and only step 7 decides it. `set:` overlap lines mean members share an area — informational; implement sequentially. If any remain untagged, refuse the rest. If any member is `all`, also require the quiet-board vouch from implement.md.
6. **Implement sequentially** in that order, running implement.md steps 0–7 per id (lightweight re-check of state, claim, branch, implement, ship). Reuse the shared ahead check if the tree is still clean.
   - **Ship stamp:** every member's ship must carry the full set: `TASKS ship <id> --batch <id,id,…> --shipped "<what actually shipped>"` (sorted ids of the whole batch; the shipped record is per task, never one summary reused across the set). That writes `Dev-batch: …` on the PR body and task body so review can gate partial review and land the set together (`flows/review-batch.md`). Per-PR `Version intent` is a suggestion; review applies one bump sized for the whole set.
   - **Every member ships to `draft`** (implement.md step 6) and stays there: promoting is per member and the user's call, so never `TASKS ready` a member to keep the batch moving. Reviewing the set is `/dev review <the same ids>` (`flows/review-batch.md`), which readies what it approves.
   - **Within-set deps:** when claim warns about unfinished deps that are earlier members of this batch (typically now `draft` after their ship), proceed. Still stop if an unfinished dep is outside the set (shouldn't happen after step 3 unless the board moved).
   - **Area collision** for a later member: re-check with `TASKS collisions <id,id,…>` for the **whole set**, not the single id — an in-set `draft` after an earlier ship is expected. Exit 2 (an outside `doing` blocker) → stop; leave already-shipped members in `draft` and report the rest. Exit 3 (every outside blocker's PR open) → the user's proceed-or-wait call, same as step 5.
   - If a later member becomes unstartable mid-batch (board moved), stop; leave already-shipped members in `draft` and report the rest.
7. **Out of scope for this path:** parallel worktrees or parallel agents for the batch, unless the user later asks. Each task still gets its own branch and PR. Prefer `origin/<integration>` as the base; if a later task truly needs unmerged code from an earlier one, stack on it: `TASKS claim <id> --stack-on <earlier-id>`, then ship as usual — the PR base is derived from the branch it was started on, so `--base` is only for overriding that. Note the dependency in the PR body. Stacking is cheap: `land` merges the parent without rewriting it, so a stacked child is only retargeted, never rebased — at any depth.
