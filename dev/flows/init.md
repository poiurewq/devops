# /dev init — identity, board creation, adoption

## Step 0 — welcome (first contact only)

When the user arrived via bare `/dev` or `/dev help` and this repo has no board, open with the following **verbatim** — don't paraphrase, don't extend; only trim a section if the user has made clear they already know it:

---
**Welcome to dev** — a shared task board that lives inside your repo, plus a workflow around it built for teams of humans *and* AI agents.

**What it is.** Every task is a small file under `.tasks/`, synced through git — so every contributor, on any machine or branch, sees the same board. Agents can work the board in parallel without stepping on each other.

**How it works.** You declare tasks (or higher-level goals — dev breaks them down). Contributors pick tasks up, each on its own branch, and everything lands through a PR. Reviews, design decisions, and approvals always come back to a human: agents draft, you decide.

**The philosophy.** Minimal ceremony. A task is a few sentences, not a spec — details get worked out at implementation time, and real design questions are surfaced to you instead of silently guessed. The tooling handles the process (branching, reviews, attribution, board hygiene) so nobody has to remember it.

Want me to set it up here? It takes about a minute — a name for attribution and a couple of choices about branches — and you can add your first task right after.

If they accept, continue below. If they decline, point at `/dev help` for later and stop — don't set anything up unasked.

Works from whatever branch the user happens to be on: board writes go through the script's hidden worktree, never the checkout.

Prerequisites: at least one commit (the script pins its board worktree to the integration branch's tip — on a brand-new repo, make an initial commit first) and a GitHub remote named `origin`. Without a remote, board commits just queue locally and PRs are impossible, so implement and review can't run; help the user add one before going further.

1. **Identity**: ask for a short stable handle (suggest one derived from `git config user.name`, never from the board's integrator or contributors — those identities are likely someone else). Identity is product-local (`<scope>/.dev/identity`). Skip if that file already exists for the target product and the user isn't asking to change it. In a monorepo, each product board gets its own identity (same handle is fine — re-run init per product).

2. **Scope** (monorepo support): if the repo hosts multiple products and the user wants a board for a subdir, confirm which one and pass `--scope <subdir>`. Default (no `--scope`) is the nearest board at/above cwd, else the repo root (create path only). Day-to-day commands require cwd under the product or `--scope`. Don't create scoped boards unprompted — one root board is the norm for single-product repos.

3. **Existing board** (`.tasks/board.yml` present for that scope): just run `TASKS init --name <handle>` — it joins and registers the contributor. Then check gh (step 5). Done.

4. **No board — adoption**:
   - *Integration branch*: propose the current or default branch; if the repo already uses iteration branches, ask which. Pass `--integration` (and `--parent`, `--iteration N`, `--iteration-name`, `--iteration-started` when applicable).
   - Run `TASKS init --name <handle> [--scope s] [--integration b] [--parent p] [--iteration N] [--iteration-name <name>] [--iteration-started YYYY-MM-DD]`. Init writes a gitignored `./board` viewer at the product root (`r` refresh, `a` toggle by-area, `e` toggle expand, `c` check, `q` quit, arrows scroll, space/b page, type id↵ to show a task) if missing, and refreshes it when it is still a stock wrapper. `TASKS board` does the same. A user-edited `./board` is left alone — `./board update` rewrites it from the installed skill anyway.
   - *Areas*: first give the user this primer (verbatim or near):

     > Areas are coarse labels for regions of the codebase. Every task gets tagged with the area(s) it will touch. They keep the board organized — but their real job is coordination: dev steers contributors away from working in the same area at the same time, which is what prevents merge conflicts. More areas enable more concurrent work; there is no fixed upper bound. The natural limiter is multi-area occupancy — propose as many stable areas as enable parallelization without typical tasks needing many areas at once (over-granularity → confusing multi-area tags).
     >
     > Prefer names that mirror the tree when the work splits by path: shortest unique path, no filename extensions (`billing/api`, not `billing/api.go`; `cli` if only one). A name with `/` is a path; parents are implied by segments. A parent listed in areas.md (`billing`) locks the whole subtree; tag that parent or the specific children, not both, and prefer children. One-offs go to `billing/other`, not the parent. Do not list a parent until you need the wide lock or it already has children. Cross-cutting work that is not a path still gets a short slash-free phrase (`docs`, `ci`). No trailing slashes and no leading `./`. Areas can be added later when tasks start clustering.

     Then: **brownfield** — scan the top-level structure and propose areas with that parallelization heuristic and path-preferring names (no hard count cap), each `TASKS area set <name> --desc "<one line>"`, user trims/confirms first. **Greenfield** — none yet; they appear later per the rule above.
   - *Existing task lists* (TODO.md, ROADMAP.md, issues dump): offer `/dev absorb <file>` (flows/absorb.md).

5. **gh setup** (PR is the only merge flow):
   - `gh` missing → point at https://cli.github.com (`brew install gh` on macOS); `gh auth status` failing → walk them through `gh auth login`.
   - Init still completes without it, but say plainly: implement and review stay unavailable until `gh auth status` succeeds.
   - **The agent harness can gate the merge too.** `land`, `cleanup` and `iteration-land` merge a pull request or delete a branch, which a permission or safety layer may refuse even when `gh` is fine. They are agent-run by design, so a refusal strands reviewed work at the last step. Say it once here: if any of them is ever refused, allow those commands wherever this harness configures permissions.

6. **Happy path for product code** (say once, briefly): land work via a task branch and PR into the integration branch — don't pile long-lived feature commits only on local integration. Implement starts task branches from `origin/<integration>`, so unpushed local-main commits get in the way (flows/implement.md will ask to park them as a PR or discard). Board state still goes only through `TASKS`, never hand-edited.

7. Report what was set up: scope, integration branch, integrator, areas, gh status, and the `./board` viewer (`r` refresh, `a` toggle by-area, `e` toggle expand, `c` check, `q` quit, arrows scroll, space/b page, type id↵ to show a task).
