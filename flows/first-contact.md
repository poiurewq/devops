# /dev (bare) and /dev help — first contact

Covers bare `/dev` and `/dev help`. Do not improvise the welcome or the options table.

## First contact (bare `/dev`)

Classify with two script calls — `TASKS board` (board?) and `TASKS whoami` (identity?):

- **Board exists** (and identity set): show `TASKS board`, then **context options only** (below) — never the full options table, and no per-command commentary. Close with one line that `/dev help` has the complete menu.
- **No board** — assume the user knows nothing beyond the name. Read `flows/init.md` and deliver its step-0 welcome **verbatim** (it exists so every agent gives the same first impression — don't improvise your own), then run the init flow if they accept. Don't dump the full command reference on them; they'll learn verbs as they need them.
- **Board exists but no identity** (new contributor): skip the sales pitch — one line ("this repo runs its task board with dev; let's get you on it"), then the init flow's identity/join steps.

### Context options (bare only; after identity)

From board state (and a light PR refresh on `draft` / `review` tasks if useful; the refresh lives in SKILL.md), emit only the lines that apply — short command shapes, ids filled in when known. Skip categories that don't apply; do not pad toward a full menu.

| When | Offer |
|---|---|
| Open forks (`needs: decision`), `proposed` tasks, or open PRs to review | `/dev review` |
| Your `doing` / `planned` / `draft` / `review` work | `/dev status` · `/dev implement <id>` (a `draft` is yours to finish, review via `/dev review <id>`, and `ready`; `review` gets a resume note) |
| Unassigned backlog and a quiet plate | 1–2 unblocked candidates via `/dev pick <id>` or `/dev implement <id>` |
| No open work on the board | `/dev add <task-or-goal>` |

Prefer the highest-signal row(s); one or two lines is enough. Always end with the `/dev help` hint.

## `/dev help`

When board and identity exist: emit the options table **verbatim** (below), plus an optional one-liner that bare `/dev` is board + next steps — nothing else. No board, or board without identity: same setup path as bare first contact (welcome / join) — don't show the table before the board is usable.

### Options table (reproduce as-is)

Every agent shows the same menu, so the user learns one map of the tool. Emit it whole — don't reorder, trim to "what's relevant", or annotate.
