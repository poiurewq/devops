# Multi-task review batch

Loaded only from `flows/review.md` when the user asked for several task ids at once (or "all under umbrella …"). Do **not** load this file for a single id — a lone PR stays on the single-id path even when open batch co-members exist (the gate only advises); a missing stack parent refuses there rather than expanding into this file. Never auto-expand a selection the gate refused or advised on — surface `batch-gate` output and let the user re-run with the set they want.

## When this applies

- Explicit multi-id: `/dev review 19, 20, 22` (or space-separated).
- **All tasks under an umbrella** with a PR out: expand that umbrella's `deps` recursively to leaves; keep only those currently `draft` or `review` with a `pr`.
- Single-id whose open **stack parent** is not selected: `batch-gate` exit 2 — **hard refuse**, list the missing parents; do not review or expand.
- Single-id that is part of a still-open Dev-batch: `batch-gate` **advises** (exit 0). Relay it and offer the full set; the user decides.

Non-goals: auto multi-review; auto-expand after a gate refuse or advisory; pairwise sibling `merge-tree`.

## Philosophy (two phases)

1. **Review all first** — no mid-batch land. Keep the stack/batch alive. A `draft` member is reviewed the same way, but approving it means `TASKS ready` (flows/review.md), not a land credit.
2. **Land only after every member is approved and in `review`** — then land in stack/topo order via `TASKS land` only. Land merges the parent with a merge commit and retargets its stacked children to integration; no sibling branch is rewritten, so landing one member is inert to the rest.

When a Dev-batch (or stack component) applies, this **supersedes** the single-review "land one then next" multi-PR path in `flows/review.md`. That path remains for inbox items with **no** shared `Dev-batch:` and no stack edges among them.

## Steps

### 0. Resolve + gate

1. Resolve every id (unknown → stop; no partial batch). Drop duplicates.
2. `TASKS batch-gate --ids <all selected>`. Exit 2 → surface the script output (missing stack parents) and **stop**. A partial-batch advisory on exit 0 is relayed, not enforced — the user picks the set.
3. Load each task: must have a PR out — `review`, or `draft` (still its author's own loop; the set can be reviewed together, but nothing lands until each draft is readied) — or already `done`/merged, skipped with a note. Refuse `proposed` / open `needs: decision` in the set for this path (handle those via the normal inbox).

### 1. Phase 1 — Review all (no land)

For each member (any order for reading; prefer stack bottom→top for context):

1. Plain sentence of purpose, then `gh pr diff` / review seriously.
2. Present findings + recommendation (approve / request changes) **for the whole set together** when possible (one sitting).
3. On **request changes** for member Tᵢ: do **not** land anyone. The author fixes on the branch and re-pushes with `TASKS ship <i> --shipped "<what changed>"`. Then propagate: `TASKS restack --ids <full open set> --after <i>` (fail-closed — a conflict aborts that rebase and stops). Earlier plan steps may already be force-pushed; that is expected, not a half-open rebase. Resolve the failed member (fix conflicts, push), then **re-run the same restack** (already-up-to-date members no-op). Do not hand-roll multi-branch rebase or try to roll back successful steps. Surface restack output verbatim.
4. On **approve** for a member: record the conversational go-ahead for that id; **do not** `TASKS land` yet. The self-approve skip for `gh pr review --approve` still applies (flows/review.md).
5. On **approve** for a `draft` member: it also has to be promoted before phase 2 can reach it — `TASKS ready <id>` on the user's go-ahead (flows/review.md). Never ready a draft the user did not approve; a member left in draft simply holds the set out of phase 2.

Repeat until every open member is approved or the user abandons the batch.

**Integrator sugar (a set of your own drafts)**: when `TASKS whoami` equals the board `integrator` and every `draft` member is assigned to them or to an `auto/…` identity (the batch form of the sugar in flows/review.md), there is no handoff to wait for. Once the whole set is approved, offer **ready + land** as one step; on the user's go-ahead, `TASKS ready <id>` each draft member — land refuses a draft, so promotion comes first for all of them — and then run phase 2's land wave in order. One explicit go-ahead covers the set, but never chain it silently, and never ready a member the user did not approve. A `draft` assigned to another human is outside the sugar: name it, promote nothing, and land it only after its author readies it.

### 2. Phase 2 — Ordered land

If `whoami` is not the board integrator, do not enter this phase. Report approvals and say only the integrator can land. Every member must also be in `review` — `land` refuses a `draft`; if any is still draft, name it and stop (its author, or the user, readies it first — the sugar above does exactly that for the integrator's own drafts).

Order edges = **union of**:

- within-set board `deps` (A before B when B lists A), and
- PR **base→head** edges among the set (child's `baseRefName` is parent's branch).

Stack edges often dominate (implement-batch stacks may share only done deps). Topo-sort; lower id breaks ties. Cycle → stop and report. Same order as `TASKS restack --ids <full open set> --dry-run` prints.

For each id in order:

1. `TASKS land <id>` only — never hand-roll merge. Land merges the parent (merge commit) and retargets its immediate children to integration; their branches are untouched, at any stack depth. Surface full output; on `error:` stop the land wave (the rest stay in `review`).
2. Version intent: for a **Dev-batch**, after the last member of the set lands, apply **one** bump sized for the whole set (greatest of the stated intents) — not one per PR. If the wave stops early, wait — do not bump twice later. A set that is **only** a stack (PR base edges, no shared `Dev-batch:`) is not one change set: those tasks merely share a branch lineage, so each keeps its own intent and gets its own bump as it lands.

### 3. Report

What was approved, restacked, landed, or left open. If `whoami` equals `TASKS config integrator` and work remains, note it — but don't auto-start another review cycle in the same breath as implement (implement wrap-up still prefers a new session; review-batch itself is already the review session). Do not tell a non-match they are the integrator.
